Feature: Register
    In order to register myself into the application
    As a non authenticated user
    I need to be able to submit a register form

    Background:
        Given locale is "en_GB"

    Scenario: Give access to register page
        Given user registration is enable
        And I am not authenticated
        And I am on "/login/"
        Then I should see an "a#link-register" element

    Scenario: Revoke access to register page
        Given user registration is disable
        And I am not authenticated
        And I am on "/login/register/"
        Then I should see "Registration is not available"

    Scenario: Register form is displayed
        Given user registration is enable
        And I am not authenticated
        And I am on "/login/register/"
        Then I should see an "a#register-classic" element
        When I follow "a#register-classic"
        Then I should see "firstName"
        And I should see "lastName"
        And I should see "email"
        And I should see "job"
        And I should see "company"
