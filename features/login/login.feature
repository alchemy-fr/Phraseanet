Feature: Login
    In order to log in into the application
    As a non authenticated user
    I need to be able to submit a login form

        Given I am not authenticated
        When I am on "/login/"
        Then I should see "login"
        And I should see "password"

        When I am on "/login/"
        And I fill in "login" with "john.doe@phraseanet.com"
        And I fill in "password" with "johndoe"
        And I press "Connection"
        Then I should be on "/prod/"
