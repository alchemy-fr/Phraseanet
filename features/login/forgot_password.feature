Feature: Forgot password
    In order to log in into the application
    As a non authenticated user
    I need to be able to get a new password if I forget my own password

    Background:
        Given locale is "en_GB"

    Scenario: Give access to forgot password page
        Given I am not authenticated
        When I am on "/login/"
        Then I should see "Forgot password?"
        When I follow "Forgot password?"
        Then I should be on "/login/forgot-password/"

    @javascript
    Scenario: Submit forgot password form with blank email
      Given I am not authenticated
      And I am on "/login/forgot-password/"
      When I fill in "email" with ""
      And I press "Send"
      Then I should see "This field is required"

    @javascript
    Scenario: Submit forgot password form with invalid email
      Given I am not authenticated
      And I am on "/login/forgot-password/"
      When I fill in "email" with "invalid_email@"
      And I press "Send"
      Then I should see "This field is not valid"

        When I fill in "email" with "jane.doe@phraseanet.com"
        And I press "Send"
        Then I should see "Unknown user"
